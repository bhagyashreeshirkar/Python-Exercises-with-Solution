Mean -
Mean is average value of all the occurrences.
Mean = sum of occurrences / total no of occurrences
For Eg, 
	occurrences = 3, 2, 5, 10
	Mean = (3 + 2 + 5 + 10) / 4 = 5
	
Mode - 
Mode is a value which occurs maximum number of times.
and if 2 numbers repeated maximum times then mode will be the smaller number.
For Eg,
type1:
	occurrences = 2, 1, 1, 6, 1, 7, 2, 1, 1, 9, 5
	Mode = 1 ( as 1 occurs maximum number of times (ie, 4) than other elements)

type2:
	occurrences = 2, 2, 3, 4, 12, 12, 4, 12, 4
	Mode should be 4 and 12; but since 4 is smaller value mode will be 4
	Therefore, Mode = 4

Median - 
For finding median occurrences must be sorted (in an ascending order) manner.
Median is a middle number among all the occurrences placed in a sorted manner.
For Eg,
type1: when total no of occurrences is odd
	occurrence = 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10
	Median = 3 (as it is exactly middle of all)

type2: when total no of occurrences is even
	occurrences = 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 13
	Median =  step1: take two middle numbers (ie, 3 and 5)
		step2: add them (ie, 3 + 5 = 8)
		step3: take average of them (ie, 8/2 = 4)
	Therefore, Median = 4


Logic for Median -

case1: when total no of occurrences is odd
	occurrence = 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10
	Median = 3 (as it is exactly middle of all)

here, total no of occurrences = 7
step1: 7 -1 = 6
step2: 6/2 = 3, hence 3 will be the index for occurrences
step3: occurances[3] = 3 = Median


case1: when total no of occurrences is odd
occurrences = 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 13
	Median =  step1: take two middle numbers (ie, 3 and 5)
		step2: add them (ie, 3 + 5 = 8)
		step3: take average of them (ie, 8/2 = 4)
	Therefore, Median = 4


here, total no of occurrences = 8
step1: 8/2 = 4, hence 4 will be the index for num1 which is middle of two numbers
step2: 4-1 = 3, hence 3 will be the index for num2 middle which is middle of two numbers
step3: now, occurances[4] = 5 and occurances[3] = 3
step4: (5 + 3)/ 2 = 4 = Median
