"""
1. array is beneficial if you need to store group of elements of same datatype.
for e.g [2, 12, 33, 45, 78, 90]
        ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
        [2.1, 4.5, 2.9, 7.3, 9.6]

2. arrays and list in python are not same; but array modules rarely used in python.

3. The size of an array is not fixed, it can increase or decrease their size dynamically.

4. arrays are small in size as compared to lists.

5. for data science we use numpy arrays for calculations but not normal arrays modules.

6.Arrays need to be declared whereas lists do not need declaration because they are a part of Python's syntax.
    (This is the reason lists are more often used than arrays.)
But in case you want to perform some arithmetic function to your list, one should go with arrays instead. ie numpy array
